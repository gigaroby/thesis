\chapter{MeshChat}
Meshchat is a prototype application designed to deliver messages to as many clients as possible without the need for centralized infrastructure.
The first step in the design of such an application is to design a protocol that will define how the messages will be distributed.
Once a basic idea of protocol is in place it is necessary to understand whether or not the communication primitives provided by Bluetooth on Android are suitable to implement the protocol.
The following chapter will describe the first iteration of the protocol, the test performed to verify the soundness of the basic primitives and the issues encountered while developing the tests.

\section{Primitives}
The API provided by the Android system to work with Bluetooth only allow access to the RFCOMM layer of the protocol stack.
Since RFCOMM emulates a serial connection it does not support sending a packet to more than one device at a time.
In order to simulate a multicast transmission the application must send messages to each of its peers individually.

An application can also discover nearby devices by requesting an inquiry scan.
The inquiry scan is a very intensive operation that consumes a lot of battery power and degrades the transmission performance of the Bluetooth radio.
Because of the drawbacks it is always best to perform short inquiry scans separated by a few minutes of pause.
