\section{Performance testing}
To investigate whether or not the primitives provided were suitable for the task, three benchmarks have been implemented, designed to be as similar as possible to real world scenarios.

\subsection{Test setup}
All the tests were performed by placing the devices being tested on a flat table with no obstacles at a distance of roughly 1 meter.
The devices were connected to a power source and rebooted before each round of tests.
Every application other than the one performing the measurements was closed.
All of the devices used for testing were running a non-modified version of the operating system installed by the manufacturer.
Table \ref{table:devices-used} contains a list of the devices used, their brand and model along with the version of Android that was installed.
