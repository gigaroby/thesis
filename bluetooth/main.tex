\chapter{Bluetooth}
Bluetooth is a technology that allows for short-range wireless data transmission between two or more devices, developed as a wireless alternative to serial connections. The Bluetooth technology was designed to emulate cables in costs, security and capabilities.

Originally developed by Ericsson, Bluetooth technology is now used in millions of devices developed by many different manufacturers.
The development of the Bluetooth technology and the licensing of the trademark are now managed by the Special Interest Group, founded in 1998 by Ericsson, IBM, Intel, Nokia and Toshiba and now consisting of more than 25000 members.
Unlike Wi-Fi, Bluetooth is designed to be energy efficient and cheap to produce. For this reason, Bluetooth is very common on portable devices like smartphones and laptops.
