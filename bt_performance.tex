\chapter{Bluetooth Performance}
In order to get an idea of how much performance could be expect from Bluetooth in real-world conditions two benchmarks were created to simulate different scenarios.
The first benchmark aimed at simulating the point-to-point transmission of a single payload such as the transfer of a picture or small video file.
The second benchmark simulated the delivery of various
